:vul_10 a :vulnerability ;
    :name "STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121" ;
    :intrusion "The PI OPC DA Interface does not correctly validate the OPC input messages before performing further processing. By sending additional valid packets, an attacker could partially control corruption to force the arbitrary freeing of a memory address. This could allow the attacker to cause a crash or to execute arbitrary code." ;

:vul_11 a :vulnerability ;
    :name "Unexpected Return Value CWE-389" ;
    :intrusion "An unexpected return value can be generated by a specially crafted packet that can cause the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk RNADiagReceiver service listening on Port 4445/UDP to stop processing packets. This vulnerability may lead to a DoS condition." ;
